Description: 

The game is a matching puzzle game where it also involves memory as you try to remember the positions of foods that are in the grid. Your goal is to match everything in the grid. Use your wits and luck to match everything. But you must be careful each mistake costs you a life! Don’t just mindlessly match the tiles. You start with 10 lives, a multiplier of 1x, and a shield count of 0. The multiplier increments by 1 if you get a match and resets to 1 if you get a mismatch.

This game has a twist. By matching, you earn points, and you may use these points to your advantage. These can be used to obtain power-ups which can help you have an edge in winning the game.
